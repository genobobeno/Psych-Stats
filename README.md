Welcome to my Psych-Stats repo

All the basic calculations necessary for analyzing datasets will be contained in this hopeful beast

The programs are set up in categories
-------------------------------------
I. Reading in data files (file format, entry, options, arrays)
II. Conditioning data (formatting matrices, arrays, calculating means, variances, errors, fits for samples)
III. Correlate data (correlations, covariances, regression, joints, dependencies)
IV. Visualize data (plotting functions, packages)
V. Output data files (format, options)
